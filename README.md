# TRILLO PROJECT

More on advanced CSS: animation using keyframes, flexbox, masks, and custom css properties like variables.

NOTE: After cloning or downloading the entire code, remember to install the *NODE MODULES* file locally in your command line or vscode terminal
for proper functionality (i.e sass compilation). Thank you.

Sorry, i have been away, so been busy. Anyohz, i just added a dropdown feature `without functionality --no javascript` to the user nav as a user profile navigation. It panned out well enough.

Added notification messages on the notification icons.
