# TRILLO PROJECT

More on advanced CSS: animation using keyframes, flexbox, masks, and custom css properties like variables.

NOTE: After cloning or downloading the entire code, remember to install the *NODE MODULES* file locally in your command line or vscode terminal
for proper functionality (i.e sass compilation). Thank you.
